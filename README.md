My Kafka

## My Kffka projects

### Project 1

Built a Java Spring Boot and Kafka application for a bank client.

- Defined the business requirements with the product owners.
- Designed the application on these criteria: data source identification, data model categorization, Kafka topic schema designs, Kafka partition strategy, retention policy choosing, replica factor definition, scalability planning etc.
- Set up the Kafka cluster with Confluent Cloud.
- Developed the microservices and then implemented the Kafka producers and consumers with Java Spring Boot.
- Tested the microservices with Postman and curl.
- Deployed the microservices to Google Cloud with Docker and Kubernetes.
